# Multiclass Image Classification using CNN (Keras) on a Custom Flower Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to classify images of different flower species within a custom dataset.

## Key Features

Image Preprocessing: Demonstrates techniques for loading, resizing, and normalizing image data.
CNN Architecture: Implements a CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, as well as regularization techniques (Dropout, BatchNormalization).
Training and Evaluation: Showcases model training, evaluation, and visualization of training and validation metrics.
Model Prediction: Demonstrates making predictions on new images using the trained model.
## Getting Started
